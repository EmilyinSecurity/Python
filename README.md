# python-projects
This repostory consists of all the projects I will work on in my Python learning journey. 
1st Project: creating a simple quiz with 20 questions which gives the user a final mark and grade.
2nd Project: a simple ATM simulator with one user and allows them to withdraw, deposit, view balance or exit. 
3rd Project: Improving Simple ATM to an advanced ATM simulator with multiple users (stored in a dictory) and it updates and prints balance when the user deposits or withdraws. It is also set up to ensure the account is not withdrawn into overdraft.
